<h2>Foglit Run</h2>
<h2>Running into Clarity</h2>
<p>The horizon was a soft whisper of pale blue and gray, a gentle promise hidden behind a curtain of morning fog. Mira paused at the water’s edge, breathing in the cool salt air. Each exhale carried away the residue of yesterday’s worries, leaving a quiet space for possibility.</p>
<p>She tied her laces with deliberate care, feeling the rough fibers cinch around her ankles. In that simple ritual, she found focus. The fog muffled the rhythm of the waves, but not the whisper of her heartbeat. With a final inhale, she lifted her foot, ready to meet the world.</p>
<p>The sand was a tapestry of footprints and driftwood, each step a new stroke in a shifting canvas. As she ran, her breaths settled into a steady cadence, <em>each footfall a meditation</em> on presence. Tiny pebbles shifted under her soles, reminding her that even the firmest ground could stir.</p>
<p>The fog curled around her body like a soft blanket, blurring the line between earth and sky. Shapes emerged and faded: a lone gull skimming the water, a distant buoy bobbing in silence. She welcomed the uncertainty, trusting her senses to guide her toward clarity hidden in the haze.</p>
<p>Halfway along the shore, the air brightened gradually. The sun’s edge painted the fog in blush tones of apricot and rose. Mira pressed on, her legs strong and steady. She watched her breath become visible puffs in front of her, like tiny ghosts dancing away with the wind.</p>
<p>Then came the moment of revelation. The fog lifted in a slow exhale, unveiling the ocean’s glassy surface. A school of fish shimmered beneath the shallow surf, flickering like living jewels. She stopped to look, breath caught in her throat, humbled by the simple beauty brought into focus.</p>
<p>She realized clarity was not a destination but a glimpse—a meeting between intention and moment. Running had always been about escape. Now it became a path toward understanding, each stride unraveling a knot in her thoughts. The salty breeze carried away fragments of doubt, replacing them with gentle certainty.</p>
<p>With a renewed heart, Mira turned back toward home. The trail behind her was imprinted in the sand, a pale mirror of her journey ahead. Each footprint was both record and promise, marking where she had been and where she would go.</p>
<p>The sun climbed higher, warming her skin and dissolving the last wisps of fog. She slowed to a walk, surveying the transformed landscape—sea glass scattered like memories, waves whispering secrets at her toes. The morning had shifted, yet it felt timeless in its quiet revelation.</p>
<p>When she reached her front porch, Mira paused once more, savoring the clarity the run had gifted her. The world ahead glowed with possibility, each breath light with promise. Inside, she carried the warmth of the ocean’s morning calm, a steady pulse guiding her day.</p>
