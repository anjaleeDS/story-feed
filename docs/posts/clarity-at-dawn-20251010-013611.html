<h2>Clarity at Dawn</h2>
<h2>Fogbound Dawn</h2>
<p>Jess laced her shoes at the water’s edge, feeling the damp chill of dawn seep through the thin fabric. A veil of mist hovered over the ocean, softening the line between sea and sky. She inhaled, tasting the salt on the breeze and listened to the quiet hiss of gentle waves. The sand beneath her feet was cold and smooth, dotted with bleached shells and the occasional foamy imprint of a wave retreating. It felt like a secret corridor that led straight into the heart of the sea, where clarity waited beyond the mist.</p>
<p>She started her run with measured steps, feeling the rhythm of her heartbeat beat against the hushed world. The fog enveloped her, reducing her surroundings to shapes and shadows. A distant gull cried, its call muffled and ghostly. She could see only a few feet ahead, where the shoreline curved into nothingness. Yet each stride grounded her: toes pressing into yielding sand, calves warming, breath rising and falling in a steady cadence.</p>
<p>Midway along the curve of the beach, doubts drifted in like wisps of mist. Was she chasing something unreachable? The horizon eluded her, hiding its secrets behind a glowing wall. Her pace faltered, and her chest grew tight. She slowed to a walk and closed her eyes, letting the damp air fill her lungs. She reminded herself that clarity often comes in gentle waves. In that moment, she realized she was not lost, only suspended—caught between what was seen and what awaited revelation.</p>
<p>She resumed her stride, this time softening her gaze. Instead of seeking forms, she felt the space around her: the slight chill on her cheeks, the muted hum of the sea, the steady pulse of her own body. Each footfall became an anchor, a tangible touchpoint in the vast gray expanse. With every step, her mind grew quieter, the clutter falling away until only the present moment remained, clear and bright like a hidden gem revealed.</p>
<p>A faint glow began to pierce the mist, pale and diffused at first, then bold and golden. She paused, breathing deeply as rays filtered through the haze, scattering light like scattered pearls on the water’s surface. In that luminous hush, the ocean’s edge reappeared in crisp detail: a ribbon of foam, pebbles gleaming, and the endless stretch of sky ascending above. A single ray found her, warming her face and lifting her spirit.</p>
<p>A smile curved her lips as she turned toward home, every sense alight with renewed purpose. The fog, once ominous and heavy, now seemed like a gift—an invitation to trust the journey rather than demand answers. In the soft glow of morning, she understood that clarity is not a distant shore but the steady unfolding of each step. She felt a gentle calm that would accompany her long after the run ended.</p>
<p>By the time she reached the dunes, the sun had burned off most of the mist, leaving the world sharp and alive. She paused atop a small rise, looking back at her footprints, now half-erased by waves. Even they bore witness to her journey—marked, yet transient. With a final breath of salty air, she carried the morning’s lesson in her heart: that sometimes, the clearest view emerges from the softest haze.</p>
